## ✨ New Features (v1.0.4)

### 👥 Smart Filtering & Player Tracking
- **Filtered Mode**: Tired of spam in massive Multiworlds? Precisely select which players you want to "follow".
- **Tracked Players**: Manage your tracking list directly from the overlay or via the launcher.
- **Noise Reduction**: Filter notifications to see only what matters to you or your group.

### ⚙️ In-Overlay Control Panel
- **Live Adjustments**: No need to restart the app! Toggle your sync mode (**Global**, **Personal**, **Filtered**) via the gear icon on the overlay.
- **Dual Syncing**: Configure independent sync modes for your **Desktop Overlay** and your **OBS Browser Source**.
- **Slot Management**: Switch profiles (Slots) instantly without manual disconnection.

## 🐧 Linux & Steam Deck (Bazzite) Support
This edition is fully optimized for Linux distributions, including immutable systems like **Bazzite** or **SteamOS**:
- 🏗️ **Hybrid Mode**: Native Python OBS server support if Node.js is unavailable.
- 🛡️ **Sandbox Bypass**: Pre-configured with `--no-sandbox` to avoid SUID errors on Linux.
- 📦 **AppImage Support**: Automatic detection of AppImage builds for a dependency-free installation.

## 🛠️ System Architecture

1.  **Control Center (`BroadCast-Archipelago.py`)**: The visual configuration interface to position the overlay and manage connections.
2.  **The Bridge (`broadcast/bridge.py`)**: The core engine maintaining the connection to the Archipelago server and handling data filtering.
3.  **Broadcast App (`broadcast-app`)**: The visual layer (Vite + React + Framer Motion) delivering smooth 60 FPS animations.
